# Agent Contracts (Frozen)

⚠️ This folder defines the canonical output schemas for Dropple AI agents.

As of Phase 1.4.1:
- Contracts are FROZEN
- Breaking changes require versioning (v2, v3)
- Agents must adapt to contracts — not the other way around

Allowed changes:
- Additive fields only
- New contract files
- Versioned contracts

Any breaking change requires architectural approval.
